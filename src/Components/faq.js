                SciCards is a free educational service that utilizes AR
                technology to bring concepts from science to life. A
                student needs just a cell phone or laptop webcam and a
                series of SciCards to start learning about components of
                anatomy, physiology, and more. Our introductory set of
                SciCards is an in-depth dive into the bones that make up
                the human body. With 11 different SciCards, a student
                will be able to examine bone structures on their cell
                phone or laptop webcam and test their knowledge.

                In the future, SciCards hopes to develop tools to help
                students learn even more about anatomy. SciCards also
                hopes to expand into other areas, allowing students to
                explore science in a more hands on way â€” without bulky
                diagrams.
